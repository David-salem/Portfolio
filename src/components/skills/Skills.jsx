                        <br />

                        Two years ago, I made the decision to expand my professional profile by gaining knowledge in software development, with the aim of implementing solutions more efficiently.

                        <br />
                        <br />

                        Currently, I am about to complete my training as a Certified Tech Developer at Digital House. Driven by my deep interest in the latest technological trends, I decided to dedicate myself entirely to software development as an independent professional, founding Oso√±oDevs.

                        <br />
                        <br />

                        This company reflects my passion for growing in the software development industry and has the mission of driving business transformation through technology. I am committed to continuing to learn and grow in this field, with the goal of contributing to the development of technological solutions.

                        <br />
                        <br />
                        
                        I firmly believe that technology is the key to fostering innovation and efficiency in any organization. If you are looking for professionalism and dedication, count on me!
